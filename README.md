# Surfs Up Weather Analysis

## Project Overview

We are meeting W. Avy utilizing the same climate analysis jupyter notebook file used in a previous challenge. W. Avy is concerned by the amount of precipitation on Oahu since there needs to be enough rain to keep Oahu green but not to the point it affects surfing and ice cream weather as we look to set up a store there. This particular analysis focuses on weather statistics between the month of June and December in order to help better understand whether or not the weather will be favorable.
